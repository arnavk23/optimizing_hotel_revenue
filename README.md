# Optimizing Revenue Leakage & Profitability in the Hospitality Sector
My summer project done using the criterias and data of C&amp;A IIT Madras

## Project Overview

This project addresses revenue inefficiencies and profit bottlenecks in the hospitality sector using real-world hotel booking data. The objective is to identify, quantify, and mitigate revenue leakage while uncovering strategies to improve operational efficiency and drive profitability across different seasons.

**Use Case Highlight**: A hotel chain experiences consistent off-season losses. By analyzing booking and service trends, we identify underutilized event spaces and propose repurposing them into co-working areas during weekdays ‚Äî backed by scenario-based ROI simulations.

---

## Key Objectives

- Detect **revenue leakage** across booking channels, services, and customer segments.
- Recommend **dynamic pricing and bundling strategies** (e.g., weekend getaways, corporate plans).
- Suggest **operational changes** like dynamic staffing or service rationalization.
- Deliver **data-backed business justifications** using scenario analysis (best, worst, and likely cases).
- Visualize key performance metrics through clear, interactive dashboards.

---

## Achievements

- Parsed and cleaned multi-file real-world datasets (e.g., `fact_bookings.csv`).
- Computed core KPIs: Total Revenue, Booking Trends, Platform Performance, Cancellation Ratios.
- Built visualizations to uncover seasonal patterns and service inefficiencies.
- Proposed actionable interventions with **quantified impact (ROI, payback time)**.
- Created reusable analysis pipelines to explore property-level profitability dynamics.

## Key KPIs Analyzed

- **Revenue Realized vs Generated** (leakage detection)
- **Booking Volume & Guest Count Trends**
- **Cancellation Rates**
- **Platform & Room Category Breakdown**
- **Seasonality & Rating Impact**

---

## Sample Insights Generated

- Platforms like ‚Äúothers‚Äù consistently underperform in realization rates.
- High cancellation ratio observed for certain booking windows.
- Revenue leakage traceable to specific platforms or room categories.
- Ratings tend to correlate positively with revenue realization.

## What I Learned

- Building end-to-end pipelines for **data-driven business strategy**.
- Translating business goals into **analytical questions** and metrics.
- Applying **data cleaning and exploratory data analysis** (EDA) on non-trivial real-world datasets.
- Understanding the value of **ROI modeling and scenario analysis** in consulting workflows.
- Improving storytelling using **dashboards and visual justifications**.

---

## How This Helps

- Strengthens ability to **analyze ambiguous, domain-specific datasets**.
- Builds intuition for **business objectives behind ML pipelines**.
- Enhances **KPI-driven decision making**, a must-have in production ML systems.
- Develops the habit of thinking in terms of **value, tradeoffs, and impact** ‚Äî not just code or models.
- Sharpens skills in **data visualization and presentation**, which are key to cross-functional collaboration.
